# Process-Scheduling-Simulator
This project simulates CPU scheduling using the Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithm with FCFS as a tie-breaker. It is event-driven, handles context switching, and calculates CPU utilization, average turnaround time, and waiting time, with a Gantt chart for visualization.
